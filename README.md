# Algorithms for Massive Data â€“ Project 1

This project implements a **similarity detector for Amazon Books reviews** (Master in Data Science for Economics, A.Y. 2024/25).  
Reviews are tokenized, stopwords removed, hashed into binary vectors, and compared via **MinHash LSH + Jaccard similarity** in PySpark.
