# Algorithms for Massive Data â€“ Project 1

This project implements a **similarity detector for Amazon Books reviews** (Master in Data Science for Economics, A.Y. 2024/25).  
Reviews are tokenized, stopwords removed, hashed into binary vectors, and compared via **MinHash LSH + Jaccard similarity** in PySpark.  
Dataset: [Amazon Books Reviews on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Authentication via Kaggle API is required.  
Run the project on Google Colab: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/YOUR_NOTEBOOK_ID).
